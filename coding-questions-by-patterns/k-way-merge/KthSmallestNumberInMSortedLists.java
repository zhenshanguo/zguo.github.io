Problem Statement # Given ‘M’ sorted arrays, find the K’th smallest number among all the
arrays.

Example 1:

Input: L1=[2, 6, 8], L2=[3, 6, 7], L3=[1, 3, 4], K=5 Output: 4 Explanation: The 5th
smallest number among all the arrays is 4, this can be verified from the merged list of
all the arrays: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8] Example 2:

Input: L1=[5, 8, 9], L2=[1, 7], K=3 Output: 7 Explanation: The 3rd smallest number among
all the arrays is 7.

Solution # This problem follows the K-way merge pattern and we can follow a similar
approach as discussed in Merge K Sorted Lists.

We can start merging all the arrays, but instead of inserting numbers into a merged list,
we will keep count to see how many elements have been inserted in the merged list. Once
that count is equal to ‘K’, we have found our required number.

A big difference from Merge K Sorted Lists is that in this problem, the input is a list of
arrays compared to LinkedLists. This means that when we want to push the next number in
the heap we need to know what the index of the current number in the current array was. To
handle this, we will need to keep track of the array and the element indices.

import java.util.*;

class Node {
  int elementIndex;
  int arrayIndex;

  Node(int elementIndex, int arrayIndex) {
    this.elementIndex = elementIndex;
    this.arrayIndex = arrayIndex;
  }
}

class KthSmallestInMSortedArrays {

  public static int findKthSmallest(List<Integer[]> lists, int k) {
    PriorityQueue<Node> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<Node>(
        (n1, n2) -> lists.get(n1.arrayIndex)[n1.elementIndex] - lists.get(n2.arrayIndex)[n2.elementIndex]);

    // put the 1st element of each array in the min heap
    for (int i = 0; i < lists.size(); i++)
      if (lists.get(i) != null)
        minHeap.add(new Node(0, i));

    // take the smallest (top) element form the min heap, if the running count is equal to k return the number
    // if the array of the top element has more elements, add the next element to the heap
    int numberCount = 0, result = 0;
    while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
      Node node = minHeap.poll();
      result = lists.get(node.arrayIndex)[node.elementIndex];
      if (++numberCount == k)
        break;
      node.elementIndex++;
      if (lists.get(node.arrayIndex).length > node.elementIndex)
        minHeap.add(node);
    }
    return result;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Integer[] l1 = new Integer[] { 2, 6, 8 };
    Integer[] l2 = new Integer[] { 3, 6, 7 };
    Integer[] l3 = new Integer[] { 1, 3, 4 };
    List<Integer[]> lists = new ArrayList<Integer[]>();
    lists.add(l1);
    lists.add(l2);
    lists.add(l3);
    int result = KthSmallestInMSortedArrays.findKthSmallest(lists, 5);
    System.out.print("Kth smallest number is: " + result);
  }
}

Time complexity # 
Since we’ll be going through at most ‘K’ elements among all the arrays,
and we will remove/add one element in the heap in each step, the time complexity of the
above algorithm will be O(K*logM) where ‘M’ is the total number of input arrays.

Space complexity # The space complexity will be O(M) because, at any time, our
min-heap will be storing one number from all the ‘M’ input arrays.

Similar Problems # Problem 1: Given ‘M’ sorted arrays, find the median number among all
arrays.

Solution: This problem is similar to our parent problem with K=Median. So if there are ‘N’
total numbers in all the arrays we need to find the K’th minimum number where K=N/2.

Problem 2: Given a list of ‘K’ sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted list.

Solution: This problem is similar to Merge K Sorted Lists except that the input is a list
of arrays compared to LinkedLists. To handle this, we can use a similar approach as
discussed in our parent problem by keeping a track of the array and the element indices.
